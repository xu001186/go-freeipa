## Known issues

### pkg.go.dev website refuses to display documentation

[![pkg.go.dev license restrictions](doc/go_freeipa_doc_license_issue.png)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ccin2p3/go-freeipa/freeipa)

The official [pkg.go.dev license policy](https://pkg.go.dev/license-policy) does not actually accepts the [CeCILL LICENSE](https://cecill.info/index.en.html) we're using.

We're aware of this and an [issue was opened to request the recognition of the CeCILL LICENSE on the pkg.go.dev](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/52126).
